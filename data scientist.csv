We foster good science. You are given the time and resources you need to build your expertise in your project, and you will guide fellow data scientists and other Crowe staff through your work.
We want to make good scientists better. Data scientists have plenty of options on the job market. We want to be one of the best ones. We have a journal club that meets weekly, regular opportunities for team members to teach each other, support for conferences, and recurring reading groups. Moreover, our team offers generous PTO, a flexible work from home policy, and a strong commitment to work-life balance. Company-wide, Crowe routinely wins awards for our support of our staff, including [to be filled in by Talent Services].
About the Role
We work on medium-term machine learning projects (1-6 months) with a high degree of autonomy.
In order to further the Data Science Team strategic imperative of having a “Culture of reuse: tools, products, and processes.”, the primary strategy of the Toolkit Team will be to develop generalizable tools for common problems and facilitate the sharing of code within/between projects.
Identify opportunities to use prior Data Science Team work to address new feature requirements
Develop generalizable tools designed to solve current and future problems
Work with all Data Science Team members to define needs
Champion the use and adoption of tools
Required Skills
Programming experience. Your job will require you to code. We mainly write in Python, so experience in this language is preferred. Within the Python ecosystem, we learn and use a wide array of tools and frameworks. Familiarity with or a drive to learn common data science and machine learning libraries is a plus.
Machine learning experience. You enjoy machine learning. You've gone deeper than reading blog posts, ideally having several example machine learning projects from industry, academia, or personal settings that you can speak to.
Capacity for autonomy. You won’t be on your own on day one, but you will need the capacity to manage your time between research and tool development.
Strong communication skills. You can discuss the technical details of a machine learning project as well as explain the concepts to a non-technical audience.
Adaptable. Toolkit problems will involve different areas of computer science and machine learning skills, sometimes within the same problem. You can context shift depending on the problem and can adjust if new problems and/or requirements arise requiring rethinking the approach to solving a problem.
Detail oriented. Toolkit is focused on making tools that just work. You like to find edge cases and potential bugs in code, you go above and beyond developing use cases beyond the requested basics, and you are meticulous with documenting their code
Skills to Stand Out
Hackiness. You like to code and have interest in learning new technologies. You find it exciting to explore and/or improve libraries to help you solve a problem.
Curiosity about machine learning. You enjoy staying up to date on research and advances in machine learning. You have a favorite machine learning specialization area that you enjoy learning about and working with.
Interest in general computer science. You know a few things about algorithm design, data structures or some other interesting computer science area that can help create more robust machine learning solutions.
Outside field. You have an educational or research background in another field that you believe gives you unique perspectives for approaching machine learning and/or general computer science problems.
